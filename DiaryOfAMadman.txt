"This night, a very good moonlight. It has been more than thirty years since I saw him; when I saw him today, my spirit was extraordinarily refreshed. I realized that the previous thirty years were faint, however, I have to be very careful. Otherwise, why would that dog of Zhao's family look at me twice? I am justifiably afraid. \

There was no moonlight today, and I knew it was bad. When I carefully went out in the morning, Zhao Guiweng looked at me strangely, as if he was afraid of me, as if he wanted to harm me.\
He seemed to be afraid of me and wanted to harm me. Seven or eight other men were whispering of me, and smiled a little at me ; I went cold from head to foot and realized  they had prepared all the arrangements.\
\
I knew that they had done everything right. I was not afraid, but went on my way. A group of children in front of me were talking about me, and their eyes were as blue as those of Zhao Guiweng.\
They had the same look in their eyes as Zhao Guiweng, and their faces were blue. I wondered what kind of grudge I had against the children, and I couldn't help shouting, "What's the matter with you, Mr. Zhao? I couldn't help but say aloud, "Tell me!\
Tell me!" They ran away.\

I can't sleep at night. All things must be studied before they can be understood.\
"They--there were those who had been shackled by the magistrate, and those who had been slapped by the gentleman, and those whose wives had been taken by the magistrates, and those whose sons and mothers had been driven to death by their creditors; and their faces were not so fearful and fierce as they were yesterday.\
There was also a man whose wife had been forced to die by his creditors; and their faces were not as frightened or as fierce as yesterday's. The strangest thing was the woman in the street yesterday.\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 The strangest thing was that the woman in the street yesterday, when she beat her son, said with her mouth, "I'm going to bite you a few times! I'm going to bite you a couple of times!\
I'm going to bite you a few times to get rid of your anger!" But he looked at me with his eyes. I was so surprised that I couldn't hide it; and the gang of green-faced people all\
laughed. Chen Laowu rushed forward and dragged me home.\
\

When I entered the study, they closed the door behind me, as if they had closed the door on a chicken or a duck. This incident made me more and more confused.\

"A few days ago, the tenants of Wolf Village came to complain about the famine, and told my elder brother that a great villain in their village had been beaten to death; a few of them dug out his heart and liver and fried it in oil to eat, so as to strengthen their courage.\
A few of them dug out his heart and liver and fried it in oil to strengthen their courage. I made a remark, and the tenant and the elder brother both looked at me a few times.\
When I interjected something, the tenants and the elder brother looked at me for a while. Today I realized that they were looking at me in the same way as those people outside.\

\uc0\u12288 \u12288 When I think of it, I am cold from the top of my head to my toes."\
\
If they can eat people, they may not eat me.\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 Look at that woman's words, "I'll bite you a few times," and the smiles of the green-faced men, and the tenants' words the day before yesterday.\
I can see that his words are all poisonous. I can see that his words are full of poison and his laughter is full of knives. Their teeth were all lined up in a white row.\
This is a man-eater.\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 I thought to myself, "Though they are not evil, it is hard to tell if they have kicked the books of the Ku family since then. They seem to have something else in mind.\
I can't guess what they have in mind. Besides, when they turn their backs, they call people evil. I remember what my elder brother taught me.\
I remember what my elder brother taught me, that no matter how good a man was, if he said a few words about him, he would give him a few circles; and if he forgave a bad man, he would say, "He is different from the others in the way he turns over the heavens with his wonderful hands.\
I am not sure how I can guess what they are thinking. How could I guess what was in their minds, especially when it was time to eat?\

Everything has to be studied before it can be understood. In ancient times, people were often eaten. I still remember this, but I do not know much about it. When I looked up the history, I found that it was not dated.\
I looked up the history and found that it was not dated, and the words "benevolence, righteousness and morality" were written on every page in a crooked manner. I went to sleep and read it carefully.\
I couldn't sleep, so I looked at it carefully for half a night, and only then could I see the words through the cracks in the text, which were all filled with the word "cannibalism"!\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 There were so many words written in the book, and the tenants said so many things, but they all smiled and looked at me with strange eyes."\
\
"I am a human being, and they want to eat me!"\

\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 In the morning, I sat quietly for a while. Chen Laowu brought in a bowl of rice, a bowl of vegetables, a bowl of steamed fish; the fish's eyes were white and hard, and its mouth was open, like those of the gang who wanted to eat people.\
The fish's eyes were white and hard, and its mouth was open, just like those who wanted to eat people. After eating a few chopsticks, I don't know whether it is a fish or a human being.\
I spat him out with his stomach and intestines.\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 I said, "Old Five, tell Big Brother that I am bored and would like to go for a walk in the garden." Old Five did not answer, but went away.\
After a short pause, he came and opened the door.\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 "I didn't move, studying how they were going to manipulate me, knowing that they wouldn't let up. And so it was! My elder brother led an old man\
An old man came slowly; he had a fierce look in his eyes, and, fearing that I might see it, he only bowed his head to the ground, and looked at me secretly through the side of his spectacles.\
He just looked down at me through the side of his eyeglasses, fearing that I would see. My brother said, "You seem to be doing well today." I said, "Yes." I said, "Yes." Big brother said, "I invited Mr. Ho to come here today to give you a consultation.\
I said, "Yes!" I said, "Yes! I said, "Sure!" In fact, I didn't know that this old man was an executioner! He is just using the pulse reading\
I am not afraid; though I don't eat, I am not afraid to eat. I'm not afraid; though I don't eat people, my guts are stronger than theirs.\
I am not afraid; though I do not eat men, my courage is stronger than theirs. I will hold out my two fists and see how he will strike. The old man sat down, closed his eyes, and touched him for a while.\
He opened his ghostly eyes and said, "Don't think. Just rest quietly for a few days and you will be fine."\

"Don't think about it, but keep them quietly! When they are fattened up, they can naturally eat more; what good am I to them, and how can I be 'better'?\
How can I be 'better'? They want to eat people, but they are sneaking around, trying to hide it, not daring to do it directly.\
This really made me laugh to death. I could not help it, so I laughed loudly and happily. I knew that this laughter was full of righteousness and courage.\

"These days is to take a step back and think: If that old man is not the executioner, but really a doctor, he is still a cannibal.\
The man is still a cannibal. Their ancestor, Li Shizhen, made the "What's in the Materia Medica", which clearly states that human flesh can be fried and eaten; can he still say that he doesn't eat humans?\
How can he still say that he is not a cannibal?\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 As for my elder brother, I have not wronged him. In his lecture to me, he personally said that he could "eat his own son";\
On another occasion, when he happened to discuss a bad person, he said that he should not only kill him, but also "eat his flesh and sleep with his skin". I was still young and my heart skipped a beat.\
I was so young that my heart skipped a beat. The day before yesterday, when a tenant from Wolf Village came to tell him about eating his heart and liver, he was not surprised and nodded his head uncontrollably.\
This shows that he is as hard-hearted as he was before. Since he could "eat from his own son", he could easily get anything and eat anyone.\
In the past, when I listened to his reasoning alone, I was also confused; but now I realize that when he reasoned, not only did he have human oil on his lips, but his heart was full of cannibalism.\
Now I realize that when he reasoned, not only did he have human oil on his lips, but his heart was full of cannibalism."\

\uc0\u12288 \u12288 I know their way, that they will not kill them outright, nor will they dare to do so for fear of evil. So they all contacted each other.\
They have spread a wide net to force me to kill myself. Just look at the way the men and women looked on the street a few days ago, and the way my elder brother acted in the past few days.\
I can realize what they are doing. It would be better to take off my belt, hang it on the beam, and strangle myself tightly; they would not be guilty of murder, and they would be able to pay for the crime of killing.\
If they are not guilty of murder and their wishes are fulfilled, they will naturally be happy and make a kind of oohing and a gulping sound of laughter. Otherwise, they were scared and worried.\
If they die of fright and sorrow, though they are a little thin, they will still be able to approve a few times.\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 They will only eat dead meat! --I remember a book that said there was something called "Hibernia" that was ugly to look at and look at.\
They often eat dead meat, and even the very large bones are chewed up and swallowed.\
It is frightening to think of it. Hai Bina is a relative of the wolf, and the wolf is the dog's family. The dog of the Zhao family looked at me a few times the day before yesterday.\
The old man's eyes were on the ground. The old man is looking at the ground, how can he hide it from me?\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 The most pitiful thing is my elder brother. He is also a human being, so why is he not afraid of me? Or is he so used to it that he doesn't think it's wrong?\
Or is he so accustomed to it that he does not think it is wrong? Or has he lost his conscience and committed the crime knowingly?\
\
\uc0\u12288 \u12288 When I curse a cannibal, I start with him; and when I want to persuade a cannibal to change his ways, I start with him.\
